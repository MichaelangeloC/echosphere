# --- Configuration for EchoSphere ---

# DOMAIN: This is the most important setting.
# It's the public-facing domain name of your server.
# For now, we will use 'localhost:5000' for local testing.
# When you deploy this for real, you would change this to "yourdomain.com".
DOMAIN = "localhost:5000"

# ACTOR_USERNAME: This will be the default "user" for our server instance.
# Think of it like the main admin or mascot account.
ACTOR_USERNAME = "server"
